# Naetverk.js
#### JavaScript framework for visual programming

## Introduction

**Naetverk** is a modular framework for visual programming. **Naetverk** is heavily based on the fantastic [rete.js](https://github.com/retejs/rete) framework,
that allows you to create node-based editor directly in the browser.

**Why a different branch?** -  I have some ideas that I follow which are in conflict with the original implementation.
